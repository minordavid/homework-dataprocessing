XMLHTTPSrequest is not used because we were not handed the code we needed in time and it was not possible
to ask questions till friday 1100 and by then it was to late to get a working code with XMLHTTPSrequest

Also because my own laptop broke and i now have to work from the cs50 IDE it is not possible to make a server
